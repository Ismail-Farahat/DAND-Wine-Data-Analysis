# Red-Wine-Data-Analysis
## Info about data:
This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
## Variables of the data:  
### Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):  
1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)  
2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)  
3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)  
4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)  
5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^)  
6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)  
7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)  
8 - density (g / cm^3)  
9 - pH  
10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)  
11 - alcohol (% by volume)  
### Output variable (based on sensory data):  
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
